#### Legitimate Silent Miners:
 <p><b> >_ Purpose:</b> Legitimate silent miners could be software designed for authorized and transparent cryptocurrency mining, often used by individuals or organizations for their own mining operations.</p>
 <p><b> >_ User Awareness:</b> In ethical scenarios, users are aware of the mining activity, and consent is obtained. The "silent" aspect may simply refer to the fact that the mining operation runs in the background without requiring constant user interaction</p>
